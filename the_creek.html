<h1> The Creek </h1>

Justin and I liked the building where we worked. 

<br>
<br>

There were some woods you could see from our office out behind the building.  Mostly pine trees.

<br>
<br>

There used to be a lot more trees here but they got rid of them and put these buildings here.

<br>
<br>

We used to leave our building together and go into the woods.

<br>
<br>

Justin and I would take the elevator down and just walk out there.

<br>
<br>

There was a creek in the woods and we'd walk alongside it.

<br>
<br>

Justin claimed we could find arrowheads out there because this used to be Cherokee land according to him but who knows.

<br>
<br>

He'd say just relax your eyes and look at the ground.

<br>
<br>

I never saw any arrowheads.

<br>
<br>

Sometimes the creek would flood after it rained and we'd have to walk further up the bank which was fine with me.

<br>
<br>

Our shoes would get really wet sometimes and I'd worry about getting in trouble at work but I tried not to walk from a place of fear.

<br>
<br>

One day some other people were down at the creek, surveyors maybe.

<br>
<br>

We hid from them by walking far away from the creek into a part of the woods where we hadn't been before.

<br>
<br>

We found something weird.

<br>
<br>

We found these old headstones.

<br>
<br>

They were small and you couldn't read the writing on them because they were old.  We tried.

<br>
<br>

We looked at all of them and then headed back to the building where we worked.

<br>
<br>

We got upstairs and Justin said Oh God.

<br>
<br>

He motioned for me to follow him and I followed him into the bathroom.

<br>
<br>

He was touching his privates and he said Oh God.

<br>
<br>

He said they're all over me.

<br>
<br>

He unbuttoned his pants and showed me that little deer ticks were swarmed all around his privates.

<br>
<br>


I told him I think those are baby ticks.

<br>
<br>


He said fuck fuck fuck.

<br>
<br>


He started to pull them off and put them in the sink.

<br>
<br>

I watched him pull off more than ten but there were still a lot of ticks all over his privates.

<br>
<br>

The ones he'd picked off were crawling back out of the sink.

<br>
<br>

I said this isn't gonna work probably.

<br>
<br>

Tears were starting to fill his eyes and I turned around and left the bathroom.

<br>
<br>


I went back to my desk and logged in to my computer and thought about how maybe I should go tell the surveyors about Justin's privates and warn them about the little gravestones.
