<h1> Barack Obama </h1>

<h2>Part I</h2>

Barack Obama called me on a Thursday evening. It was around 9 pm and traffic was still settling and the sun had not yet set. I was not expecting the call.
<br>
"Hello?"
<br>
"Hi, Alex."
<br>
"Hey. Who's this?"
<br>
"Hey. This is Barack Obama."
<br>
It turned out the president was passing through Syracuse, attending to certain matters, and needed a place to stay. My roommate was out of town so it was not inconvenient.
<br>
"She won't mind me sleeping in her room?"
<br>
"Oh, not at all."
<br>
"I appreciate it, man."
<br>
"No sweat."
<br>
Obama got in fairly late that Sunday and had a little trouble finding parking on the street. I went down to meet him and teased him about his crooked parallel parking.
<br>
I had some leftover stir-fry which I offered to Barack Obama. He said he was fine because he had eaten a big bag of almonds on the road.
<br>
We sat up late, chatting and smoking. Barack Obama would come in from the balcony and go to the bathroom to wash his hands after each cigarette, which I also do a lot of the time. Finally, we got ready for bed.
<br>
"Goodnight, Barack."
<br>
"'Night. Oh, Alex?"
<br>
"Yeah?"
<br>
"I was gonna take a shower. Where can I find a towel?"
<br>
"Closet behind you."
<br>
He picked one of my roommate's nice white towels and went into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. I heard the bathroom fan start up and I didn't see him again until the next morning.
<br>
<h2>Part II</h2>
<br>
When I came out of my room, Barack Obama was already up, doing crunches on a towel in the living room. This was not the same towel he had used the night before, since that one was still wet. He had already made coffee.
<br>
"I didn't know whether you guys compost so I put the old grounds in the filter in the sink."
<br>
"We just toss them out."
<br>
"Cool", said Barack Obama, and then he did a few more crunches before going to take a shower and then joining me in the kitchen.
<br>
We both had cereal and read the paper. I gave Barack Obama the Arts section because I thought he'd like the article about Steve Reich, which I read while Barack showered.
<br>
"What was the name of the journalist he did the tribute to?", he asked.
<br>
"Daniel Pearl?"
<br>
"Yep", said Barack Obama, nodding and glancing back down at the paper.
<br>
<h2>Part III</h2>
<br>
After breakfast, Barack Obama thanked me for putting him up and said he'd text to see if I wanted to get lunch before he headed back to Washington, D. C., where he lived.
<br>
We both left the apartment at around 9:15 and I went to work. At around 2pm I went to get a coffee and discovered I'd missed Barack Obama's text because I don't always get reception in the building where I work.
<br>
"Sry I missed this! Dive safd and let me know if yr back this way soon!"
